## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/taskstride.git
cd taskstride
```

### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set a strong JWT_SECRET
npm install
npm start
# API running at http://localhost:3001
```

### 3. Setup Frontend

```bash
cd frontend-app
cp .env.example .env
# .env already points to http://localhost:3001/api for local dev
npm install
npm run dev
# Frontend running at http://localhost:5173
```

---

## Deployment on Railway

The repo ships with `railway.toml` configs in `backend/` and `frontend-app/`. Two services in one Railway project, deployed via CLI or dashboard.

### Backend service

1. New Service → connect this GitHub repo
2. **Settings → Source → Root Directory:** `/backend`
3. **Settings → Networking → Target Port:** `3001` → Generate Domain
4. **Variables:**
   ```
   JWT_SECRET=<48-byte random hex>
   PORT=3001
   DATABASE_URL=file:./taskstride.db
   FRONTEND_URLS=<paste frontend URL after step below>
   ```

### Frontend service

1. New Service in the same project → connect the same repo
2. **Settings → Source → Root Directory:** `/frontend-app`
3. **Settings → Networking → Generate Domain**
4. **Variables** (must be set **before** first build — Vite inlines them):
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://<backend-domain>/api
   ```
5. Trigger redeploy

### Wire CORS

After both domains exist, update backend `FRONTEND_URLS=https://<frontend-domain>` and redeploy backend.

### CLI alternative

```bash
brew install railway && railway login
cd backend       && railway add --service backend  && railway up --service backend  && railway domain
cd ../frontend-app && railway add --service frontend && railway up --service frontend && railway domain
```

### Database persistence

The app uses **LibSQL** with a local file (`taskstride.db`). **Railway containers are ephemeral** — the DB resets on every redeploy.

For real persistence pick one:
- **Railway Volume** — mount a Volume in backend service and set `DATABASE_URL=file:/data/taskstride.db`
- **Turso** (hosted LibSQL, generous free tier) — set `DATABASE_URL` to the Turso connection string

---

## Database Schema

```sql
users (id, name, email, password, created_at)

projects (id, name, description, admin_id, created_at)

project_members (project_id, user_id, role, joined_at)
-- role: 'admin' | 'member'

tasks (id, project_id, title, description, due_date, priority,
       status, assignee_id, created_by, created_at, updated_at)
-- priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
-- status: 'todo' | 'in_progress' | 'done'
```

---

## Design Decisions

1. **LibSQL over SQLite3/better-sqlite3**: Native bindings (`sqlite3`, `better-sqlite3`) require build tools (`node-gyp`) not always available in CI/CD. `@libsql/client` is pure JS and works everywhere including Railway out of the box.

2. **No frontend router library**: The app uses simple state-based routing (`view` string) to keep the bundle lean and avoid React Router configuration overhead for this scale.

3. **JWT in localStorage**: Simple and effective for this use case. For higher security requirements, httpOnly cookies would be preferable.

4. **Cascade deletes**: Project deletion cascades to members and tasks at the DB level — no orphaned rows.

5. **Member-only task visibility**: A user cannot see tasks in projects they don't belong to — enforced at the API middleware layer.

---

## Demo Credentials

**Local dev:** After starting the backend once, a demo user is seeded automatically:

- Email: `demo@taskstride.app`
- Password: `demo123`

**Smoke check (manual):** With frontend on `http://localhost:5173` and API on `http://localhost:3001`, sign in with the credentials above — you should land on the dashboard. Wrong password should show a red inline error under the fields and **keep** your typed email/password (no full-page reload).

Create an account via `/signup`, then:
- Create a project (you become Admin)
- Add teammates by their registered email
- Create and assign tasks
- Team members can update status on their tasks
